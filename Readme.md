# Envirosaurus

This code is for the Easy As Pi project at Living Sky School Division.

This project involves getting 300 Raspberry Pis to collect environmental data using Pimoroni Enviro+ modules, and to report that data back to a central system where that data can be displayed in a central manner, ideally on TV-sized displays, in map form.

## Anatomy of a Pi sensor module
The following components make up a sensor module:
 - A Raspberry Pi Zero W board (we are using the first generation boards)
 - An Enviro+ module

 - A 3D-Printed case - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3954675
   - Note: We did not design this case, and claim no credit for it. We merely found it on Thingiverse.
 - A MicroSD card for the Pi
 - An official Raspberry Pi power supply
